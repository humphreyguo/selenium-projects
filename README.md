## Repo contains some programs I wrote because I wanted to learn about selenium
Current bots:
1) Tiktok scroll bot
- Bot used to make the tiktok browser edition an effortless watch. Bot will automatically scroll to the next video once the video is over. Bot also prompts you to sign in via a facebook login.
3) Typing test bot
- My attempt to beat my mates at a typing test. Not sure if working.
5) Tigers Jersey form bot
- A bot used to submit multiple forms at once in attempt to 'rig' a raffle for a tigers jersey. Didn't win in the end as I stopped running the bot after 20 submissions. Roughly 1 form submission/2 secs. (Not sure if legal XD)
